<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       MakeMe  and  its  "<B>me</B>"  command is modern replacement for the venerable
       make and not so popular autoconf utilities.  MakeMe manages the  build-
       ing  of  programs  and products by effectively determining which pieces
       have been updated and thus which components need to be rebuilt. It eas-
       MakeMe  replaces  both  autoconf  and make with a single utility: 'me'.
       MakeMe provides a higher level of abstraction  to  easily  specify  the
       targets to build (libraries, executables, files and script output).  It
       can build directly on Linux, Mac or Windows and cross compile for other
       platforms.  It  will generate native projects for Visual Studio, XCode,
       Make, Nmake and shell scripts. MakeMe builds fast without the  complex-
       ity of autoconf and make.

       MakeMe  was  initiated  after evaluating Make, CMake and GYP for use by
       Appweb and Ejscript  in  an  embedded,  cross-compilation  environment.
       While  all three can be made to work, at Embedthis, we were expending a
       large percentage of time on the build system and  less  on  the  actual
       product. Our design goals were:

           . Create a build too to be used by Embedthis for its own products
           . Be portable across the major Unix platforms and Windows
           .  Easily manage cross-compilation and cross-compilers for embedded
       targets
           . Generate native projects for IDE integration
           . Build quickly, reliably and flexibly on Windows without requiring
       Cygwin
           .  Support for the entire build cycle: C dependencies, compilation,
       test and packaging
           . Support  modular  discovery,  configuration  and  integration  of
       external third-party packages
           . Be hackable and extendable


</PRE>
<H2>FEATURES</H2><PRE>
       MakeMe has the following major features:

           . Configuration and component discovery (replaces autoconf)
           . Compiler capability sleuthing
           . Generation of a configuration source header (me.h)
           .  Generation of Xcode, Visual Studio, Make, Nmake and shell script
       projects
           . Automatic C/C++ source code dependencies
           . Projects can aggregate multiple MakeMe files without using recur-
       sion
           . Cross platform. Easily handles Windows, Linux and Mac builds
           . Easy cross-compilation
           . Building outside source tree for read-only file systems
           .  MakeMe  files  are Javascript source and are easily modified and
       extended
           . Multiple build profiles (debug, release, ...)
           . Very fast configuration and building, even on windows


</PRE>
<H2>NICE BITS</H2><PRE>
       While MakeMe has a strong feature set, there are  some  characteristics
       that make building with MakeMe especially nice:

           . Unified project view. No "make" style recursion required.
           . MakeMe configuration may be comprised by multiple MakeMe files

       A  MakeMe file is a Javascript file with a '.me' extension that invokes
       Me.load() to process a set of build instructions.  The  build  instruc-
       tions are expressed as a Javascript object literal that Me.load() inte-
       grates into the master set of build instructions.

            Me.load({
                targets: {
                    /* Build the rocket executable */
                    rocket: {
                        type: 'exe',
                        sources: ['*.c'],
                    },
                },
            })

       To build the rocket, enter:

            <B>me</B> <B>rocket</B>



</PRE>
<H2>INVOCATION</H2><PRE>
       When 'me' is invoked, it searches for a 'start.me' file in the  current
       directory.  If  one  if  not found, it searches up the parent directory
       chain for one. MakeMe then loads this  'start.me'  file  and  commences
       processing  its  build instuctions. A 'start.me' may in turn load other
       MakeMe files.



</PRE>
<H2>STANDALONE USES</H2><PRE>
       A standalone start.me file may be used to express simple build  targets
       that do not requiring any prior configuration step. The 'start.me' file
       contains targets that specify the recipies to build those targets.



</PRE>
<H2>CONFIGURED PRODUCTS</H2><PRE>
       Some products require a configuration  phase  prior  to  building  with
       MakeMe.  Configuration  involves  discovering  the tools and components
       available on the current system and the available compiler  tool  chain
       support.   For  configured products, 'me' is first invoked with a "con-
       figure" target. MakeMe then reads a 'main.me' file which describes  the
       project,  and  generates  a  'start.me'  and  'platform.me'  file  that
       describes the system.



</PRE>
<H2>TARGETS</H2><PRE>
       MakeMe is typically invoked with zero or  more  targets  to  build.  If
       invoked  with  zero targets, MakeMe will build all the out-of-date tar-
       gets. If a one or more targets are specified, only those  targets  will
       be brought up to date.

       To build all targets:
            <B>me</B>

       To  configure  a product before building, run MakeMe using the 'me con-
       figure' target or alternatively use the '-config' switch.  When config-
       uring,  MakeMe  will load a 'main.me' file and use the details from the
       'settings' properties to tailor the configuration. The settings provide
       a 'name', 'description', and 'version'.

       For example, this is a typical 'settings' configuration.

            settings: {
                name: 'mpr',
                description: 'Multithreaded Portable Runtime',
                version: '4.0.5',
            },

            The  'configure' properties define the required and optional pack-
            ages that should be discovered.

            configure: {
                requires: [ 'osdep' ],
                discovers: [ 'ssl' ],
            },

       The 'requires' property defines the packages that are  required  to  be
       present on the system to build. The



</PRE>
<H2>CROSS COMPILING</H2><PRE>
       To  build  a product for platform different to that of the local system
       is called cross compiling. Sometimes this cross compiling is just for a
       different  instruction  set (say x64 instead of x86). Other times it is
       for a completely different operating system and/or CPU architecture. In
       such  cases  a  cross-compiler  may be required to build for the target
       platform.

       MakeMe supports cross compiling via the 'me <B>-platform</B>  <B>OS-ARCH</B>  config-
       ure'  switch.  This adds a platform to the list of platforms to be made
       when building. Multiple platforms may  be  specified  and  the  'local'
       platform alias may be used for the local development platform.

       Some products require local building to make tools that are required to
       build for any platform. These products  add  a  "platforms:  ['local']"
       property  to  their settings collection in the main.me file. This auto-
       matically adds the local platform to the platforms list and is the same
       as adding '-platform local' on the command line when configuring.

            <B>me</B> --platform windows-x64-debug -configure .

       This  will  create  a  windows-x64-debug.me  configuration  file  and a
       start.es that references it. The platform switch does not  need  to  be
       respecified after configuration.





</PRE>
<H2>DEPENDENCIES</H2><PRE>
       MakeMe targets can depend on other targets that must  be  built  first.
       MakeMe  targets  have a name which may be depended upon by another tar-
       get. For example:

            targets {
                first: {
                    build: "print('Build First')",
                },
                second: {
                    depends: ['first'],
                    build: "print('Build Second')",
                }, }

       Before MakeMe begins building, it parses the entire MakeMe file config-
       uration  and  determines  which targets depend on what.  It then builds
       the targets in the required build order. It  successfully  detects  and
       handles dependency loops.



</PRE>
<H2>DEFAULTS</H2><PRE>
       Often  targets  need  very  similar  configuration.  MakeMe  provides a
       'defaults' set of properties that are inherited by all targets. It also
       provides an 'internal' set of properties that are inherited by only the
       targets in the same MakeMe file. For example:

            defaults: {
                '+defines': [ 'TUNE=SPEED ],
                '+libraries': [ 'math' ],
            }

       This will use the  'TUNE=SPEED'  compiler  define  when  compiling  all
       source  files,  and  the  'math'  library when linking executables (and
       libraries on some systems).



</PRE>
<H2>OVERRIDING</H2><PRE>
       MakeMe has default command flags for the  compiler,  linker  and  other
       tools.  These can be overridden by providing environment variables con-
       taining alternate flags to use. Use CFLAGS to provide  compiler  flags,
       DFLAGS for pre-processor definitions, IFLAGS for compiler include paths
       and LDFLAGS for linker flags. If these flags are provided to 'me'  when
       building,  they  apply  to that run only. If the flags are provide when
       configuring, they are saved in the generated platform file and apply to
       all subsequent runs.



</PRE>
<H2>DEBUGGING</H2><PRE>
       With  Make  and  other  build tools, it is difficult to determine why a
       target is or is not being built. MakeMe provides a  '--why'  switch  to


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>--benchmark</B>
              Measure the elapsed time to run 'me'.


       <B>--configuration</B>
              Display  the current configuration. This displays the configura-
              tion for each package and the build settings.


       <B>--configure</B> <B>/path/to/source/tree</B>
              Configure the project to prepare for building.  This  configures
              MakeMe for building the project based on the instructions speci-
              fied in a 'main.me' located in the specified path  source  tree.
              When run, 'me' will create a platform configuration MakeMe file,
              a build output directory  and  me.h  header.  The  configuration
              directory  is of the form: build/OS-ARCH-PROFILE where OS may be
              freebsd, linux, macosx, solaris, vxworks, windows  and  ARCH  is
              arm, mips, ppc, x64 or x86. PROFILE is typically set to debug or
              release. For example: 'build/macosx-x64-debug'.

              MakeMe will  use  the  settings.required  and  settings.discover
              properties  in  the main.me for a list of packages to use.  When
              configuring, MakeMe will search for these packages and will cre-
              ate  definitions in the configuration MakeMe file for later use.


       <B>--continue</B>
              Continue to build despite any build errors. Normal operation  is
              to stop building if any build errors are encountered.


       <B>--debug</B>
              Enable  a  debug build. This enables the settings.debug property
              which controls whether debug symbols will be created  when  com-
              piling.


       <B>--deploy</B> <B>directory</B>
              Install  the product to the deployment directory. This is useful
              to stage the required files to install on a system.  Use  --sets
              to define the file sets to deploy.


       <B>--depth</B> <B>level</B>
              Set the unit test depth level.


       <B>--diagnose</B>
              Run MakeMe with stack backtrace display on errors.


       <B>--force</B>
              Override warnings and proceed with the  operation.  See  --over-
              write to write over existing files.


       <B>--gen</B> <B>[make|nmake|sh|vs|xcode|main|start]</B>
              Generate  files.  This  option  can  be used to generate initial
              start.me or main.me files or IDE  project  and  makefiles.   The
              --gen  start,  option can be used to create a stand-alone sample
              start.me file. The --gen main, option can be used  to  create  a
              sample  main.me file when starting a new product.  Project files
              are created under the 'projects' directory.   The  projects  are
              based   on   the   current  configuration.  If  cross-generating
              projects, you will typically need to also use -configure.


       <B>--get</B> <B>field</B>
              Get a field from the MakeMe DOM. This can be used to display any
              MakeMe  file value. Unlike --set, this applies to any MakeMe DOM
              value and not just to settings.  For  example:  'me  --get  set-
              tings.version'.


       <B>--import</B>
              Import the standard MakeMe configuration "makeme" directory into
              the local source tree.


       <B>--keep</B> Keep some intermediate build files. This is  currently  used  by
              some documentation generation targets.


       <B>--log</B> <B>logName[:logLevel]</B>
              Specify  a  file to log internal execution messages. MakeMe will
              log execution related trace to the log file. The log level spec-
              ifies the desired verbosity of output. Level 0 is the least ver-
              bose and level 5 is the most. The '-v' switch is  an  alias  for
              '--log stderr:2'.


       <B>--nocross</B>
              Don't  cross-build. Build only for the local development system.


       <B>--nolocal</B>
              Don't build for the local development system. Build only for the
              cross platforms.


       <B>--out</B> <B>path</B>
              Save  MakeMe trace output to a file instead of displaying to the
              linux-arm-debug --with ejscript configure


       <B>--pre</B>  Pre-process a source file to stdout.


       <B>--prefix</B> <B>dir=path</B>
              Set the installation directory prefix. Various products  utilize
              different  prefixes.  Typical  prefixes  are: root, base, state,
              data, app, vapp, bin, etc, inc, log, spool, src, web.  For those
              familiar  with autoconf, the major autoconf prefixe switches are
              supported and mapped as follows: --prefix to root,  --bindir  to
              bin,  --libdir to lib, --includedir to inc, --sysconfdir to etc,
              --libexec to app, --logfiledir to log, --htdocsdir to  web,  and
              --manualdir to man.


       <B>--prefixes</B> <B>debian|embedthis|opt</B>
              Select  an  installation  prefix  package.  Debian specifies the
              debian recommended installation  locations.  Embedthis  products
              install  by  default with a prefix of /usr/local/lib/PRODUCT and
              symlink exectuables  to  /usr/local/bin.   The  opt  prefix  set
              installs with a prefix of "/opt".


       <B>--profile</B> <B>defaultProfile</B>
              Set  the  default  profile if unspecified. Typical profiles are:
              'debug', 'dev', 'stage', 'prod' or 'release'.   The  profile  is
              used in constructing the build output directory. You may specify
              override properties in the main.me profiles[PROFILE] collection.


       <B>--quiet</B>
              Quiet operation. Suppresses output trace.


       <B>--rebuild</B>
              Rebuild the specified targets. Can also use 'me rebuild'.


       <B>--reconfigure</B>
              Re-run configuration using the prior configuration settings.


       <B>--release</B>
              Enable  a  release build. This disables the settings.debug prop-
              erty and compiles without debug symbols.


       <B>--rom</B>  Configure setting to build for systems without  a  file  system.
              This  enables  the  ROM file system.  Use the makerom utility to
              process required files into C source code for building with  the

       <B>--show</B> Show the actual commands executed by MakeMe.


       <B>--static</B>
              Configure to  build  using  static  linking  instead  of  shared
              libraries. Same as --set static=true.


       <B>--unicode</B>
              Set the character size to wide.


       <B>--unset</B> <B>key=value</B>
              Clear a settings property.  Use this when running 'me configure'
              to persist your changes in the configuration MakeMe file.


       <B>--version</B>
              Print the <B>ejs</B> command version and exit.


       <B>--verbose</B>
              Run in verbose mode with more trace about MakeMe activities.


       <B>--watch</B> <B>msec</B>
              Watch for changes and rebuild if required. This will  sleep  for
              the  requested  number  of  milliseconds  between  checking  for
              changes. This can also be invoked as 'me watch' which will check
              every second for changes.
